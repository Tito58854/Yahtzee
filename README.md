The project I chose was a dice simulation for the use in a game of Yahtzee, the program is a standalone simulation of what it would be like to roll 5 dice at time, while allowing the user to save specific dice rolls over the course of three rounds. As of now the program does not keep track of scoring and must be used in conjunction with a Yahtzee scorecard . However, the complexity of analyzing user input and ensuring no crashes take place was the main focus of this program. 

Intended function: 
The program rolls 5 dice for the user at the start, then the user saves specific dice values out of the 5 and rerolls the unwanted values again. These rerolls are done for three rounds in hopes of making specific combinations. Such combinations are 5 of a kind, 4 of a kind, full house, large straight, small straight, etc. The program will weed out unwanted input like letters, symbols, out of range values, duplicate die choices, and incorrect format of input. Program is meant to run to completion without any crashes or errors.
